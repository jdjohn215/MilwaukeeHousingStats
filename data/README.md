This directory contains property data for the City of Milwaukee.

For MPROP derived files, each year prior to the current one represent year-end data. The current year's data was updated shortly before the time indicated on the file's timestamp. These files only include information about *houses* in the City of Milwaukee. Houses includes single family homes, condos, duplexes, and triplexes. It *excludes* apartment buildings. Any column with the name `median_value_adj` includes inflation-adjusted dollar value, using the **June 2022** CPI. In all cases, the aldermanic district refers to those districts adopted [after the 2020 census](https://github.com/jdjohn215/City-of-Milwaukee-Elections/blob/main/reference-maps/AldermanicDistricts2022.pdf) and `city_nhood` refers to the neighborhoods defined in the [2001 Neighborhood Identification Project](https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/neighborhoods).

The RETR derived files contain counts of property flows between different ownership categories as a result of transactions. The net conveyance flows between ownership types do not exactly match the overall changes in ownership categories in the MPROP file because properties sometimes change ownership status *without* being sold.
