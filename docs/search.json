    "text": "This report continues the Lubar Center’s focus on the state of Milwaukee’s housing. Previously installments have documented the end of the residency requirement for city workers, the collapse in owner occupancy following the Great Recession, increased investment by out-of-state landlords, and high-frequency eviction by large corporate landlords.\nOur latest study reveals something new. Since 2018, homeownership has begun rebounding across Milwaukee. No other four-year period since our data begins in 1990 has seen an increase in homeownership this large. At the same time, several private equity backed out-of-state investors have also rapidly expanded their holdings. They focus on lower-priced houses in specific neighborhoods, putting them in direct competition with the would-be home buyers already living there.\n\n\nThis digital report was last updated in August 2022. My intention is to update this website several times a year with the latest data and analysis.

    "text": "Compared to 2018, an additional 2,930 homes are now owner-occupied in the city of Milwaukee. Homeownership fell by 12 percentage points of the city’s total housing stock from 2005 to 2018. In the last 3-and-a-half years, it has recovered by two percentage points. We are still a long way from the owner occupancy levels that characterized the 1990s and early 2000s, but this is real, significant positive change.\nThe largest proportional gains occurred in the 3rd and 4th aldermanic districts, which cover the east side and downtown. But growth in owner-occupancy isn’t limited to the wealthy, mostly white neighborhoods along the lake. The largest raw increase in the number of owner-occupied houses occurred in the 10th and 5th districts, along the west and northwest fringe of the city, where owner occupancy increased by 2.8 percent of the housing stock. The 6th, 7th, and 15th districts–which make up the near northern core of the city–saw a cumulative increase of 658 more homeowners.\nSimultaneously, out-of-state investors have rapidly expanded their holdings. As of mid-2022, they own over 7,100 houses (18% of the rental stock), up from 5,200 (12%) at the end of 2018. Three private equity backed landlords now account for 20% of these properties, up from 1% in 2018. These companies focus on relatively affordable houses across the north side of Milwaukee, putting them in direct competition with would-be homebuyers in these neighborhoods.\nIn the early 2010s, real estate investors commonly bought properties from distressed homeowners–whether at sheriff sales or in preforeclosure transactions. The new breed of private equity backed investors instead mainly acquires properties other, smaller landlords. Increasingly, these houses are sold in package deals and often for cash. This kind of sale completely excludes hopeful homebuyers from the market–even though the residents of these neighborhoods could often afford the houses if they were priced individually.\nSection 2 of this report documents the increase in owner-occupancy since 2018. Section 3 describes the concurrent increase in out-of-state investor activity. Section 4 discusses the consequences of this competition between homeowners and investors. Section 5 traces property transaction flows between different classes of ownership. Section 6 concludes with observations about the trajectory of Milwaukee’s housing market since the Great Recession."

    "text": "Owner-occupancy reached a modern high in 2005, when about 80% of Milwaukee’s houses were home to their owner.1 That fell precipitously for over a decade thereafter, reaching a low of about 68% in 2018. Then, the city finally turned the corner on the long housing crisis. Each year since 2018 has seen sustained growth in owner occupancy. Owner occupancy now stands at 70%. There are 2,930 more owner-occupied houses in Milwaukee now than at the end of 2018.1 Owner-occupancy is determined by comparing the address to which the City sends the property tax bill with the address(es) at the property in question. In the case of multi-unit homes, like a duplex or triplex, an owner-occupied household may also contain renting households.\nOwner-occupancy has always been highest for single family homes, followed by condos, then duplexes and triplexes. Each category followed a similar trajectory of steep declines until the mid or late 2010s, followed by a recent recovery.\n\nSingle family homeownership grew by 1,510 or 1.6% of all homes since 2018.\nCondo homeownership grew by 320 or 2.5%\nDuplex homeownership grew by 1,020 or 2.9%\nTriplex+ homeownership grew by 80 or 2.3%\n\n\noverall owner-occupancyby home typetable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Owner occupancy rates by property type\n    \n    \n      City of Milwaukee, selected years\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      parcels\n      owner occupied\n      \n        by property type\n      \n    \n    \n      condo\n      duplex\n      single family\n      triplex+\n    \n  \n  \n    1990\n133,632\n79.3%\n77.8%\n58.0%\n90.2%\n32.9%\n    1995\n132,418\n78.9%\n79.6%\n56.7%\n89.7%\n34.3%\n    2000\n131,567\n79.1%\n79.0%\n57.6%\n89.4%\n34.0%\n    2005\n134,276\n79.9%\n81.3%\n59.1%\n89.6%\n35.4%\n    2010\n136,840\n74.2%\n72.9%\n52.4%\n84.8%\n30.1%\n    2015\n135,136\n69.1%\n70.4%\n46.5%\n78.9%\n24.2%\n    2016\n134,969\n68.5%\n71.0%\n45.8%\n78.2%\n23.0%\n    2017\n134,746\n68.6%\n71.9%\n45.7%\n78.1%\n22.7%\n    2018\n134,742\n68.4%\n72.4%\n45.7%\n77.8%\n23.5%\n    2019\n134,958\n68.7%\n71.8%\n46.5%\n78.0%\n24.5%\n    2020\n135,048\n69.2%\n72.9%\n46.9%\n78.5%\n25.3%\n    2021\n134,927\n69.8%\n74.0%\n47.8%\n79.0%\n25.7%\n    2022\n135,139\n70.3%\n74.9%\n48.5%\n79.4%\n25.8%"

    "text": "2.2 By Aldermanic District\nOwner-occupancy has increased in each of the city’s 15 aldermanic districts, relative to 2018. 22 Aldermanic districts are a useful way to compare trends within the city because they divide the population into 15 equal chunks. Of course, this doesn’t translate to equal numbers of houses because the mix of single family homes, apartment buildings, and duplexes varies between districts. This report exclusively uses the aldermanic district boundaries drawn after the 2022 census.\nThe largest raw increase in the number of owner-occupied houses occured in the 10th and 5th districts, along the west and northwest fringe of the city. Compared to 2018, there are now 331 more owner occupiers in the 5th and 276 in the 10th. Combined, the share of owner-occupied homes in this part of the city has risen by 2.8 percentage points–from 76.6% in 2018 to 79.4% in 2022.\nThe 6th, 7th, and 15th districts–which make up the near northern core of the city–saw a cumulative increase of 658 more homeowners. This is a 1.9 percentage point increase in the share of houses occupied by a homeowner.\nThe largest proportional increases came in the 3rd (East Side) and 4th (downtown) districts. Together, they added 414. The owner-occupied share has grown from 3.7 percentage points–from 66% in 2018 to 69.7% in 2022.\nBay View and neighboring parts of the south side are covered by the 14th district. Here, homeownership increased by 201, or 1.8 points.\nHomeownership grew by 385 (or 1.7% of the housing stock) on the far south and southwest sides (the 11th and 13th districts).\nHomeownership grew the least on the near south side.

    "section": "2.4 Homeownership by race",
    "text": "2.4 Homeownership by race\nThe recent increase in owner-occupancy was driven by an active housing market. The City of Milwaukee saw 6,655 originated home mortgages in 2021, up from 4,863 in 2018.44 Mortgage statistics are calculated from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act dataset maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nOwner-occupancy grew by 566 in 2019, 714 in 2020, 805 in 2021, and by 844 just through the first half of 2022.\nAs discussed above, some amount of this growth reached most of the city, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it benefited all racial or ethnic groups in anything approaching equal measure. The housing crisis, after all, had a vastly more negative affect on Black Milwaukeeans overall than white residents. The share of Black householders who were owner-occupiers fell from 36% in the late 2000s to 25% in the late 2010s.5 The share of non-Hispanic white householders who were owner-occupiers fell from 60% to 56%.5 In current Census Bureau parlance, “householder” “refers to the person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained) or, if there is no such person, any adult member, excluding roomers, boarders, or paid employees. If the house is owned or rented jointly by a married couple, the householder may be either the husband or the wife. The person designated as the householder is the”reference person” to whom the relationship of all other household members, if any, is recorded.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Share of households which are owner-occupiers\n    \n    \n      by race or ethnicity of the householder\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Total\n      Black\n      White\n      Hispanic or Latino\n      Asian\n    \n  \n  \n    2005-09\n48.6%\n35.6%\n59.5%\n39.9%\n46.1%\n    2010-14\n43.0%\n30.5%\n56.1%\n35.9%\n39.6%\n    2016-20\n40.7%\n25.2%\n55.8%\n38.5%\n39.9%\n  \n  \n    \n      Data is from the American Community Survey. The universe of households includes those living in apartment buildings.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThis report is primarily based on parcel data, which does not include demographic information about owners or residents. Still, the trends are stark. Majority black neighborhoods saw massive drops in owner-occupancy. In 2006, 73.6% of houses in majority Black wards were owner-occupied, compared to 85.7% in majority non-Hispanic white wards. By 2018, that had fallen to 57.9% in majority Black wards and 80.5% in majority white ones. The owner-occupancy rate of houses in majority Hispanic or Latino wards fell from 73.3% in 2006 to 63.6% in 2018.\nSince 2018, growth has occured across Black, white, and Hispanic majority wards alike, but the largest proportional growth is among white wards (+2.2 percentage points), followed by Black-majority wards (+1.7), and majority Hispanic wards (+1.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Owner-occupied houses by racial or ethnic majority group\n    \n    \n      in City of Milwaukee wards\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Black\n      \n      \n        White\n      \n      \n        Hispanic or Latino\n      \n    \n    \n      pct1\n      parcels\n      pct1\n      parcels\n      pct1\n      parcels\n    \n  \n  \n    2006\n73.6%\n43,477\n85.7%\n39,129\n73.3%\n11,701\n    2010\n67.0%\n39,710\n83.1%\n39,263\n68.8%\n10,981\n    2014\n60.9%\n35,367\n80.6%\n37,955\n65.6%\n10,336\n    2018\n57.9%\n33,411\n80.5%\n37,859\n63.6%\n9,995\n    2022\n59.7%\n34,619\n82.7%\n38,994\n64.9%\n10,187\n  \n  \n    \n      2011 wards are used, with demographics drawn from the 2020 census.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Share of all houses which are owner-occupied\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nOf course, an increase in owner-occupancy in neighborhoods with majority Black residents does not necessarily mean that Black owner-occupancy has increased. Non-Black residents could be making up that difference. We do not currently have recent enough Census Bureau data to measure the recent increase in owner-occupancy. But most mortgage applications do contain self-reported data about the race of the applicants.6 The following table shows those trends since 2018.6 Race or ethnicity is not available in about 10% of cases.\nSeveral things stand out. One is the remarkable increase in total mortgages beginning in 2020. In 2019, 4.3% more mortgages were originated than the previous year. That increased by 12.7% in 2020 and a further 16.4% in 2021.\nThe racial gap between mortgage recipients is enormous. In the latest census data, there were 1.1 white adults in Milwaukee for every 1 Black adult. In 2018, white mortgage recipients outnumbered Black ones by 3.6 to 1 in the City of Milwaukee. Black mortgage recipients did narrow the gap over the next few years. From 2018 to 2021, the number of Black people receiving a mortgage grew by 93%, while the number of white recipients grew by 36%. Put differently, the ratio of white-to-Black mortgage recipients fell from 3.6 in 2018 to 2.9 in 2019, 2.5 in 2020, and 2.1 in 2021.\nCensus records show a ratio of 2.2 white adults for every Hispanic or Latino adult. In 2018, there were 3.9 white mortgage recipients for every Hispanic one, falling to 3.8 in 2019, 3.7 in 2020, and 3.4 in 2021.\nAsians, by contrast, were slightly more likely to receive mortgages. Census records show a ratio of 8.2 white adults for every Asian adult. In 2018, there were 7.6 white mortgage recipients for each Asian one, falling to 7.2 in 2019, rising to 8 in 2020, and falling again to 6.7 in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Originated home mortgages in the City of Milwaukee\n    \n    \n      by self-reported race\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n        total\n      \n      \n        White\n      \n      \n        Black\n      \n      \n        Hispanic\n      \n      \n        Asian\n      \n      \n        Other/Joint\n      \n      \n        Not Available\n      \n    \n    \n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n      count\n      pct1\n    \n  \n  \n    2018\n4,863\n-\n2,549\n-\n704\n-\n653\n-\n334\n-\n187\n-\n436\n-\n    2019\n5,073\n4.3%\n2,505\n−1.7%\n858\n21.9%\n652\n−0.2%\n346\n3.6%\n193\n3.2%\n519\n19.0%\n    2020\n5,716\n12.7%\n2,719\n8.5%\n1,075\n25.3%\n742\n13.8%\n342\n−1.2%\n253\n31.1%\n585\n12.7%\n    2021\n6,655\n16.4%\n2,906\n6.9%\n1,358\n26.3%\n864\n16.4%\n432\n26.3%\n306\n20.9%\n789\n34.9%\n  \n  \n    \n      Data source: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act dataset.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Percent change since the previous year\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn general, non-white Milwaukeeans are still underrepresented in the homebuying market–this is especially acute for Black residents. Nonetheless, the hot housing market of the past few years has cut into this gap. Collectively, the number of Black, Latino, and Asian mortgage recipients grew by 57% from 2018 to 2021."

    "text": "As in many cities across the country, Milwaukee’s home sales market grew very hot during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis of transaction records found that about 7,300 houses were sold in a self-reported arms length transaction during 2018.1 That grew to 7,600 in 2019 and 8,000 in 2020, before jumping all the way to 10,000 in 2021. Through May 2022, Milwaukee was on pace to match the previous year’s total, but rapidly rising interest rates may dampen demand in the latter half of the year.1 We used Real Estate Transaction Returns (RETR) submitted to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.\nHeavy competition for available properties drove rapid price increases. Zillow’s Home Value index placed the typical Milwaukee home at $127,000 in June 2019 and $183,000 in June 2022, an increase of 44% over three years.22 https://www.zillow.com/milwaukee-wi/home-values/\nMilwaukee didn’t conduct property reassessments in 2021. In 2022, the median home was assessed at $139,900, up from $117,200 in 2020.3 Nominally, these assessments now exceed the values at the peak of the pre-housing crisis boom. In 2008, the median assessment was $128,600.3 Assessments are based on sales data from the previous year, so 2022 assessments reflect 2021 prices.\nOf course, the picture is quite a bit different when adjusted for the current high-inflation environment. When applying the June 2022 value of the dollar backwards, we see that prices reached the equivalent of $185,000 in 2006. Adjusted for inflation, the jump from 2019 to 2020 was actually larger than the jump from 2020 to 2022.\n\ngraphtable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian assessed home value, not inflation adjusted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian assessed home value, real June 2022 dollars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Median assessed home value\n    \n    \n      for houses in the City of Milwaukee\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      nominal\n      real1\n    \n  \n  \n    1990\n$47,400\n$106,477\n    1991\n$47,500\n$102,796\n    1992\n$50,700\n$106,448\n    1993\n$50,800\n$103,712\n    1994\n$54,200\n$107,534\n    1995\n$54,500\n$105,371\n    1996\n$58,700\n$110,387\n    1997\n$59,100\n$108,651\n    1998\n$64,100\n$115,968\n    1999\n$64,500\n$114,108\n    2000\n$72,100\n$123,417\n    2001\n$72,600\n$120,981\n    2002\n$83,800\n$137,246\n    2003\n$89,300\n$143,083\n    2004\n$98,700\n$154,216\n    2005\n$112,300\n$169,292\n    2006\n$126,400\n$183,348\n    2007\n$127,600\n$181,642\n    2008\n$128,600\n$173,838\n    2009\n$116,700\n$160,128\n    2010\n$111,900\n$151,796\n    2011\n$112,000\n$146,433\n    2012\n$95,800\n$123,176\n    2013\n$91,800\n$116,244\n    2014\n$91,800\n$114,284\n    2015\n$91,300\n$113,388\n    2016\n$92,200\n$113,310\n    2017\n$94,500\n$113,940\n    2018\n$100,200\n$117,661\n    2019\n$102,800\n$118,627\n    2020\n$117,200\n$133,472\n    2022\n$139,900\n$139,900\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 June 2022 inflation adjusted dollars\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Aldermanic Districts\n\n\n\nHome prices vary tremendously around the city–from a median value of $62,000 in the 15th district to a high of $270,000 in the 3rd.

    "text": "4.2 Price distribution\nThe relative affordability of houses has been bright spot in Milwaukee’s housing struggles since the Great Recession. While obviously advantageous to would-be homebuyers, this has also made Milwaukee more attractive to investors. A landlord can charge rents for a low-priced home that are comparatively higher, as a proportion of the property’s value. Existing research finds that rents are most profitable in the poorest neighborhoods of America’s poorest cities.4 5 The flip side of this is that working class families can save significantly on a monthly basis by buying instead of renting.64 Demers, Andrew and Eisfeldt, Andrea L., Total Returns to Single Family Rentals (February 13, 2021). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3791631 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.37916315 Desmond, Matthew and Wilmers, Nathan, “Do the Poor Pay More for Housing? Exploitation, Profit, and Risk in Rental Markets,” American Journal of Sociology 124 (4), 2019.6 In a 2021 study, we estimated that “the average renter of a $75,000 single-family home pays about $227 more a month than it would cost to own the property.”\nRecent increases in housing prices have reduced, but not eliminated, the pool of low-priced houses in Milwaukee.7 In 2018, half of houses were assessed below $100,000. In 2022, 30% are. The pool of homes worth less than $50k is almost gone (7% down from 19%). Twenty-six percent of homes are worth between $100,000 and $150,000, compared to 28% in 2018.7 The following statistics are all presented in nominal dollars. Adjusting for inflation would make these differences less dramatic, but inflation is currently a quickly moving target. Also, it is not yet clear how much Milwaukee worker’s paychecks have caught up with inflation, meaning inflation-adjusted benefits to affordability may not be real for typical workers.\n\ntablehistogram\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Proportion of houses in each price bin\n    \n    \n      City of Milwaukee property assessments, nominal values\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Fewer than $50k\n      $50k to $100k\n      $100k to $150k\n      $150k to $200k\n      $200k or more\n    \n  \n  \n    2018\n19%\n31%\n28%\n13%\n9%\n    2019\n17%\n31%\n28%\n13%\n10%\n    2020\n13%\n28%\n27%\n18%\n14%\n    2022\n7%\n23%\n26%\n23%\n22%\n  \n  \n    \n      Reassessments were not conducted in 2021."

Since 2018, the number of properties owned by a landlord based in the Milwaukee suburbs fell by 1,504. Ownership by landlords based in the City of Milwaukee fell by 2,603.8 Aside from some condo developments, few new houses are built in Milwaukee. Recall that this study focuses on houses–meaning single family homes, condos, duplexes, and triplexes–not apartment buildings.\nThe pace of these changes appears to be accelerating. The graph below shows annual changes in the number of houses owned by each class of owner. The value for 2022 is through mid-year, so I present the doubled value in gray as well. This represents the potential year-end value if the current pace of acquisitions continues.99 Rising interest rates and growing economic uncertainty make it more likely that the housing market will cool off. Any estimate has a high degree of uncertainty.\nAlready, in mid-2022, the number of houses acquired by an out-of-state landlord exceeds the number acquired in all of 2021. Owner-occupier acquisitions have also quickened, though not at the same pace. Just through mid-2022, growth in owner-occupiers has reached 105% of last year’s total."

    "text": "4.4 Owner-occupiers vs. investors\nDuring the Housing Crisis, investors with ready access to cash gobbled up enormous numbers of previously owner-occupied homes at bargain prices. Many of these properties underwent formal foreclosure, but others were purchased from distressed owners before things got that far–hence the proliferation of “We buy houses” signs on light poles in struggling neighborhoods across American cities.\nWhile that dynamic explains the burst in out-of-state ownership during the early and mid-2010s, it is not what is happening in Milwaukee’s housing market now. Instead, both owner-occupancy and out-of-state investment are increasing simultaneously.\nAs discussed in Section 3, the bulk of out-of-state investment is currently occurring in about 1/3rd of the city, specifically the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 15th districts. The other west and north side districts are also experiencing a more limited amount of investor activity. Collectively, these districts have also seen significant growth in owner-occupancy. These are among the city’s most affordable neighborhoods for aspiring working class homeowners. Because property values are relatively low, they are also among the most profitable investments for landlords.\nThis dynamic places would-be homeowners and private equity backed investors in direct competition for the same kinds of properties in many of the same neighborhoods. The graph below shows the change, from 2018 to 2022, in the number of owner occupied houses vs. houses owned by an out-of-state landlord in each district.\n\nThe 12th district alone has experienced little change in either category.\nAnother set of districts has seen growth in owner occupation, but little change in out-of-state investment. These include the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 11th, 13th, and 14th districts.\nThe 1st and 7th districts have seen a sharp increase in out-of-state investment–far exceeding their more modest increases in owner-occupiers.\nThe final set of districts is seeing significant growth in both categories.\n\nGrowth in owner-occupation and out-of-state investment is evenly matched in the 6th district.\nInvestors have a slight edge in the 2nd and 15th districts.\nOwner-occupiers are outpacing investors in the 9th and 10th districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Aldermanic Districts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following graph presents the same data by neighborhood.\n\nNeighborhoods including Murray Hill, Jackson Park, Brewer’s Hill, the Lower East Side, and Riverwest have all experienced owner-occupancy growth along with an outright decline in out-of-state investment.\nOwner-occupancy growth has substantially outstripped investment in Kops Park, Polonia, Washington Heights, and Bay View.\nNeighborhoods including Lincoln Village, Arlington Heights, North Meadows, Rufus King, Borchert Field, Wahl Park, and Franklin Heights have seen little or no increase in owner occupancy, but they have seen more properties acquired by out-of-state investors.\nOld North Milwaukee, Lincoln Creek, and Silver Spring have seen large amounts of out-of-state investment–far exceeding owner-occupancy growth.\nOwner occupiers and investors are competing in Capitol Heights, Washington Park, Thurston Woods, Sherman Park, Uptown, Saint Joseph, and Harambee. But in these neighborhoods, investors have acquired more than owner-occupiers in the last few years.\nThe reverse is true in Nash Park, Sunset Heights, Menomonee River Hills, Grasslyn Manor, and Midtown. Here, there is significant investor activity, but even more growth among owner occupiers."

Compared to a few years ago, many fewer properties are owned by local and suburban landlords. Who, then, is selling to whom?\nNet transaction flows to and from a given ownership category inevitably vary from the overall changes of ownership in each category for several reasons. (1) The flow file contains slightly more recent data than the MRPOP dataset. (2) Some properties are sold multiple times. (3) Most importantly, properties can change ownership status without being sold or otherwise conveyed. For instance, the net transaction flow from landlords to owner occupiers is larger than the total citywide increase in owner-occupied properties. This is mainly due to the prevalence of non-sale conversions of owner-occupied properties into something else. It is far more common for an owner-occupier to move out of their property (and presumably turn it into a rental) than it is for a landlord to move into one of their rental properties (thereby converting its status to owner occupation)."

This grew by 76% to 181 in 2021. The number of such sales has already reached 149 through just the first half of 2022.3 Identifying meaningful bulk sales from the list of all property conveyance records poses challenges. Large landlords often transfer properties between their myriad LLCs, but simply limiting the analysis to self-reported “arm’s length” transactions misses some genuine sales. I restrict this analysis to conveyances meeting the following criteria: (1) there is no stated relationship between the grantor and grantee, (2) that grantor’s address is different than the grantee’s, and (3) the conveyance is either arm’s length or not arm’s length but still subject to a transfer fee.\nThe number of residential properties sold in these transactions has likewise increased, from 343 in 2017 to 630 in 2021, and 584 through June 2022. If this pattern repeats itself in the latter half of the year, Milwaukee could see over 1,000 of its houses sold in a multi-property deal.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Residential properties sold in multi-property sales\n    \n    \n      in the City of Milwaukee\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      sales\n      parcels\n    \n  \n  \n    2017\n103\n343\n    2018\n121\n495\n    2019\n125\n481\n    2020\n148\n437\n    2021\n181\n630\n    20221\n149\n584\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Includes conveyances reported through June 2022.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n \nHouses sold in package deals tend to be quite affordable on an individual basis. The properties sold this way since 2021 have a median 2022 assessed value of $80,700. But would-be homebuyers, particular in this price range, can’t compete with the kinds of buyers who can pay cash for multiple properties at once. In all likelihood, many of these properties aren’t even listed on MLS.\nBulk purchases have been particularly popular with Milwaukee’s three private equity backed companies. Through June 2022, we identified 5 package purchases by SFR3, in which they acquired 58 houses. Highgrove Holdings used 11 bulk sales to buy 186 properties, and VineBrook bought 184 properties in 28 transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Multi-property purchases\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      package sales\n      properties\n      total paid\n      per property\n    \n  \n  \n    Highgrove Holdings\n11\n186\n$10,307,651\n$55,417\n    SFR3\n5\n58\n$4,830,900\n$83,291\n    VineBrook Homes\n28\n184\n$19,954,968\n$108,451\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nHighgrove Holdings was the buyer in 4 of the 5 largest deals. Each of those deals involved buying out the portfolio of another out-of-state landlord who was leaving the market, and all four were conducted between June 30, 2021 and January 21, 2022. Three of the transactions were with companies owned by Sergio Pejoves, in which it spent $6,609,336 buying 100 properties. The other transaction was $1,326,815 for 31 properties owned by Alan and Liqun Schapiro. Both Pejoves and the Schapiros were featured in an April 2021 MJS article about out-of-state landlords.\nMany bulk purchases aren’t large. VineBrook Homes has recorded 20 multiple property deals in 2022 through June, with an average size of 6.4 parcels. In total, the company spent $14,547,968 on 128 houses. Per property values ranged from $80,000 to $148,000 with a median of $109,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Multi-property purchase by VineBrook Homes during 2022\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      grantor\n      parcels\n      total paid\n      per property\n    \n  \n  \n    2022-01-20\nHomepointe Rentals LLC\n3\n$240,000\n$80,000\n    2022-01-06\nJoseph  Passalacqua\n6\n$630,000\n$105,000\n    2022-01-06\nJoseph  Passalacqua; Hope  Albers\n2\n$205,000\n$102,500\n    2022-01-24\nSac3 LLC\n9\n$985,970\n$109,552\n    2022-01-24\nSac4 LLC\n5\n$550,625\n$110,125\n    2022-01-24\nSac5 LLC\n7\n$757,770\n$108,253\n    2022-01-24\nSac6 LLC\n2\n$211,024\n$105,512\n    2022-01-24\nSac7 LLC\n20\n$2,431,770\n$121,588\n    2022-01-24\nSac20 LLC\n2\n$193,809\n$96,904\n    2022-01-25\nSingle R Holdings Company LLC\n5\n$467,356\n$93,471\n    2022-01-25\nHomes For Living Mke, LLC\n4\n$382,644\n$95,661\n    2022-02-15\nMary E Zierke\n3\n$360,000\n$120,000\n    2022-02-15\nSteven M Cimbalnik\n2\n$240,000\n$120,000\n    2022-02-24\nMark A Cimbalink\n14\n$1,701,241\n$121,517\n    2022-02-24\nSimba Homes, LLC\n11\n$1,236,259\n$112,387\n    2022-03-07\nRobert E Gariepy Jr\n5\n$610,000\n$122,000\n    2022-03-08\nMetro City Apartments, LLC\n5\n$740,000\n$148,000\n    2022-03-14\nAndrew J Nagel Aka Andrew  Nagel\n4\n$375,000\n$93,750\n    2022-03-16\nCornerstone Properties LLC\n13\n$1,730,000\n$133,077\n    2022-04-07\nBrittain Brothers LLC\n6\n$499,500\n$83,250"

    "text": "In some cities, that initial boom in rental home investment featured a new breed of private equity backed institutional investors. The largest of these is Invitation Homes, which is now publicly traded and owns about 80,000 properties.1 Invitation Homes and its competitors focused on Sunbelt metros with growing populations and more recent housing stock.1 https://www.invitationhomes.com/about-us\nInstead of these large companies, Milwaukee’s out-of-state investment during the early and mid-2010s mainly came in the form of wealthy individuals from states like California, Illinois, Texas, and Florida. They would buy houses in Milwaukee for what seemed to them like bargain basement prices, list them for comparatively high rents, and contract with local property managers for all the physical requirements of being a landlord. None of this requires an actual corporeal presence in the city. At least one California-based landlord interviewed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel admitted that she had never as much as set foot in the city. There are Youtube channels and web forums full of people discussing the merits and logistical details of this kind of investment in Milwaukee. Multiple property managers in Milwaukee explicitly cater to these kinds of investors on their websites.\nIn the late 2010s, a few private equity backed companies realized they could successfully apply the “SFR” business model developed in the Sunbelt to postindustrial cities with declining populations. Research suggests they may not stand to gain as much from property appreciation as investors in wealthier cities, but the profits from rent in these cheaper, poorer cities is likely even higher. This is because rents do not decline proportionately with home values.\nOf course the combination of low home values and high rents also encourages many residents to seek out homeownership. Owning one’s own house is a realistic proposition for a wider swathe of the income distribution in Milwaukee than it is in superstar cities, where home prices often exceed the reach of even traditional middle class professions like public school teachers and municipal employees.\nThree private equity backed companies entered the Milwaukee house rental market around 2018. Unlike most of the individual investors who preceded them, these companies are vertically integrated. They offer most services, ranging from acquisition to property management, in-house. Their deep financial backing allows them to buy at a pace previously unseen in Milwaukee. Instead of buying properties one-at-a-time from distressed homeowners, these companies mostly buy from other, smaller landlords. Recently, each company has used multi-property sales to buy out whole portfolios of their smaller competitors.\nThese private equity landlords make homeownership less attainable, not necessarily by driving up prices, but by purchasing affordably priced properties in such a way that residents are entirely excluded from the marketplace.\nIn an effort to address this dilemma, Acts Housing launched an acquisition fund in August 2022 designed to compete with large investors.2 Ideally, the fund will be able to match the advantages of speed, liquidity, and scale that currently keep aspiring owner-occupiers from competing with larger investors. After purchasing properties, Acts Housing will use its existing operations to sell those properties to community members. The fund has a stated goal of acquiring 100 homes in 2023. Based on current trends, that would put them in strong competition for being the second-largest purchaser of houses in the city.2 The fund was launched in collaboration with the Community Development Alliance and with an initial $1 million grant from the Zilber Family Foundation.\nAs Milwaukee’s housing market continues to evolve and draws more interest from outside investors, creative approaches like this one will be key for local actors promoting safe and affordable housing. The emergence of landlords with very large portfolios–both locally based and otherwise–raises the stakes. Local institutions need to prepared to intervene if and when one of these actors decides to exist the market."
